This project is akin to a record-keeping journal, created exclusively for educational purposes. It offers guidelines and best practices for establishing a proper, scalable project structure. It reflects my journey of learning and exploring these paradigms.

while some implementation might not align with your preferences, notice any inconsistencies or may contain an errors, you're welcome to provide feedback or suggestions regarding those matters, you can do so by creating an "issue" using the features available on this platform.
